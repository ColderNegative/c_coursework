### Program and What it does?
The program first generates a maze using the deep first search algorithm with 
an implemented stack data structure, then the program uses the same algorithm to
solve the maze and create a path for the robot to follow, which once again uses
the DFS algorithm to navigate the path fast. The top left of the maze is the start 
and the bottom right is the end.

### Compile and Running the Program
 - This command can be used to compile and run the program
> $ gcc main.c graphics.c && ./a.out | java -jar drawapp-2.0.jar

 - If wish just to compile the code, the following can be used
> $ gcc main.c graphics.c
 - This will compile to an executable a.out
